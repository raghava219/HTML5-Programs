         <p>It's easy to explain what a pronoun is: It's a word used in place of a noun. Saying, "She ran away," 
when you mean your cat, is an example of a pronoun in action. But using pronouns correctly can be tricky, because they come in different types,
 and some of these types come in a variety of forms, so that before you know it, you can't even explain where you've been all day. Is it, 
"Joe invited Bill and me to play golf"? Or "Bill and I"?</p>
