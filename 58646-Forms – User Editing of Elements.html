     In this video, we're going to look at another exciting new feature of HTML5. It used to be that when you placed an element on
	 the screen its content was fixed. The user couldn't edit it. Now, with a new attribute in HTML5, you can open these elements to
	 editing by the user. I'm going to show you the code right now. 
  </p>
  <p contenteditable>
     I've already created this HTML5 basic document structure. Now, of course, if you're going to make content user editable, 
	 you've got to have some content to edit. So I'll put in a paragraph element here, and I'll paste in there some Latin text, 
	 doesn't really matter what the content is, as long as the user can edit it, so there we go. So now, normally within a 
	  tag of course, that will be fixed within the browser, and the user wouldn't be able to do anything with that content, 
	 so we'll go ahead and just bring that up in Chrome.
